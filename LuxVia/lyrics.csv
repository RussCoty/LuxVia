1,1 Corinthians 15:51-5,"<p>Behold! I tell you a mystery.<br/>
We shall not all sleep,<br/>
but we shall all be changed,<br/>
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.<br/>
For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,<br/>
and we shall be changed.<br/>
For this perishable body must put on the imperishable,<br/>
and this mortal body must put on immortality.<br/>
When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality,<br/>
then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”<br/>
“O death, where is your victory?<br/>
O death, where is your sting?”<br/>
The sting of death is sin,<br/>
and the power of sin is the law.<br/>
But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>",reading,,New Testament
2,1 Thessalonians,"<p>4:13-18</p>
<p>But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.</p>",reading,,New Testament
3,1st Letter St. Paul Corinthians 15-20-28,"<p>15: 20-28<br/>
Brothers and Sisters:<br/>
Christ has been raised from the dead,<br/>
the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.<br/>
For since death came through a human being,<br/>
the resurrection of the dead<br/>
came also through a human being.<br/>
For just as in Adam all die,<br/>
so too in Christ shall all be brought to life,<br/>
but each one in proper order: Christ the firstfruits;<br/>
then, at his coming, those who belong to Christ;<br/>
then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom<br/>
to his God and Father, when he has destroyed<br/>
every sovereignty and every authority and power.<br/>
For he must reign until he has put<br/>
all his enemies under his feet.<br/>
The last enemy to be destroyed is death,<br/>
for &quot;he subjected everything under his feet.&quot;<br/>
But when it says that everything has been subjected,<br/>
it is clear that it excludes<br/>
the one who subjected everything to him.<br/>
When everything is subjected to him,<br/>
then the Son himself will also be subjected<br/>
to the one who subjected everything to him,<br/>
so that God may be all in all.</p>

<p>4: 1-2,6-8</p>
<p>I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,<br/>
who will judge the living and the dead,<br/>
and by his appearing and his kingly power:<br/>
proclaim the word; be persistent<br/>
whether it is convenient or inconvenient;<br/>
convince, reprimand, encourage<br/>

For I am already being poured out like a libation,<br/>
and the time of my departure is at hand.<br/>
I have competed well;<br/>
I have finished the race;<br/>
I have kept the faith.<br/>
From now on the crown of righteousness awaits me,<br/>

will award to me on that day, and not only to me,<br/>
but to all who have longed for his appearance.</p>

Then Peter proceeded to speak and said,<br/>
&quot;In truth, I see that God shows no partiality.<br/>
Rather, in every nation whoever fears him<br/>
and acts uprightly is acceptable to him.<br/>
You know the word [that] he sent to the Israelites<br/>
as he proclaimed peace through Jesus Christ,<br/>
who is Lord of all, what has happened all over Judea,<br/>
beginning in Galilee after the baptism<br/>
that John preached,<br/>
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth<br/>
with the holy Spirit and power.<br/>
He went about doing good and healing all those<br/>
oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.<br/>
We are witnesses of all that he did<br/>
both in the country of the Jews and (in) Jerusalem.<br/>
They put him to death by hanging him on a tree.<br/>
This man God raised (on) the third day<br/>
and granted that he be visible,<br/>
not to all the people, but to us,<br/>
the witnesses chosen by God in advance,<br/>
who ate and drank with him<br/>
after he rose from the dead.<br/>
He commissioned us to preach to the people and testify<br/>
that he is the one appointed by God<br/>
as judge of the living and the dead.<br/>
To him all the prophets bear witness,<br/>
that everyone who believes in him will receive<br/>
forgiveness of sins through his name.&quot;</p>

a river trembles with fear.<br/>
She looks back at the path she has traveled,<br/>
from the peaks of the mountains,<br/>
the long winding road crossing forests and villages.<br/>
And in front of her, she sees an ocean so vast,<br/>
that to enter there seems nothing more than to disappear forever.<br/>
But there is no other way.<br/>
The river can not go back.<br/>
Nobody can go back.<br/>
To go back is impossible in existence.<br/>
The river needs to take the risk of entering the ocean<br/>
because only then will fear disappear,<br/>
because that&#x27;s where the river will know<br/>
it&#x27;s not about disappearing into the ocean,<br/>
but of becoming the ocean.</p>",reading,,Poems

A Reading From The Holy Gospel According To Luke</p>
<p>24: 13-16,28-35</p>
<p>Now that very day two of them were going to a village<br/>
seven miles from Jerusalem called Emmaus,<br/>
and they were conversing about all the things<br/>
that had occurred.<br/>
And it happened that while they were conversing<br/>
and debating, Jesus himself drew near<br/>
and walked with them, but their eyes<br/>
were prevented from recognizing him.<br/>
As they approached the village<br/>
to which they were going, he gave the impression<br/>
that he was going on farther.<br/>
But they urged him, “Stay with us,<br/>
for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.”<br/>
So he went in to stay with them.<br/>
And it happened that, while he was with them at table,<br/>
he took bread, said the blessing, broke it,<br/>
and gave it to them.<br/>
With that their eyes were opened and they<br/>
recognized him, but he vanished from their sight.<br/>
Then they said to each other, “Were not our hearts<br/>
burning within us while he spoke to us on the way<br/>
and opened the scriptures to us?”<br/>
So they set out at once and returned to Jerusalem<br/>
where they found gathered together the eleven<br/>
and those with them who were saying,<br/>
“The Lord has truly been raised<br/>
and has appeared to Simon!”<br/>
Then the two recounted what had taken place<br/>
on the way and how he was made known to them<br/>
in the breaking of the bread.</p>

For a break that would make it okay<br/>
There&#x27;s always some reason<br/>
To feel not good enough<br/>
And it&#x27;s hard at the end of the day<br/>
I need some distraction<br/>
Oh, a beautiful release<br/>
Memories seep from my veins<br/>
Let me be empty<br/>
Oh, and weightless and maybe<br/>
I&#x27;ll find some peace tonightIn the arms of the angel<br/>
Fly away from here<br/>
From this dark cold hotel room<br/>
And the endlessness that you fear<br/>
You are pulled from the wreckage<br/>
Of your silent reverie<br/>
You&#x27;re in the arms of the angel<br/>
May you find some comfort hereSo tired of the straight line<br/>
And everywhere you turn<br/>
There&#x27;s vultures and thieves at your back<br/>
And the storm keeps on twisting<br/>
You keep on building the lies<br/>
That you make up for all that you lack<br/>
It don&#x27;t make no difference<br/>
Escaping one last time<br/>
It&#x27;s easier to believe<br/>
In this sweet madness<br/>
Oh, this glorious sadness<br/>
That brings me to my kneesIn the arms of the angel<br/>
Fly away from here<br/>
From this dark cold hotel room<br/>
And the endlessness that you fear<br/>
You are pulled from the wreckage<br/>
Of your silent reverie<br/>
You&#x27;re in the arms of the angel<br/>
May you find some comfort hereYou&#x27;re in the arms of the angel<br/>

<p>11: 32-45</p>
<p>When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him,<br/>
she fell at his feet and said to him,<br/>
“Lord, if you had been here,<br/>
my brother would not have died.”<br/>
When Jesus saw her weeping<br/>
and the Jews who had come with her weeping,<br/>
he became perturbed and deeply troubled,<br/>
and said, “Where have you laid him?”<br/>
They said to him, “Sir, come and see.”<br/>
And Jesus wept.<br/>
So the Jews said, “See how he loved him.”<br/>
But some of them said, “Could not the one<br/>
who opened the eyes of the blind man<br/>
have done something so that this man<br/>
would not have died?”<br/>
So Jesus, perturbed again, came to the tomb.<br/>
It was a cave, and a stone lay across it.<br/>
Jesus said, “Take away the stone.”<br/>
Martha, the dead man’s sister, said to him,<br/>
“Lord, by now there will be a stench;<br/>
he has been dead for four days.”<br/>
Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you<br/>
that if you believe you will see the glory of God?”<br/>
So they took away the stone.<br/>
And Jesus raised his eyes and said,<br/>
“Father, I thank you for hearing me. I know<br/>
that you always hear me; but because of the crowd<br/>
here I have said this, that they may believe<br/>
that you sent me.”<br/>
And when he had said this, he cried out in a loud voice,<br/>
The dead man came out,<br/>
tied hand and foot with burial bands,<br/>
and his face was wrapped in a cloth.<br/>
So Jesus said to them, “Untie him and let him go.”<br/>
Now many of the Jews who had come to Mary<br/>
and seen what he had done began to believe in him.</p>

Are you unaware that we<br/>

We were indeed buried with him<br/>
through baptism into death,<br/>

we too might live in newness of life.<br/>
For if we have grown into union with him<br/>
through a death like his,<br/>
we shall also be united with him in the resurrection.<br/>
We know that our old self was crucified with him,<br/>
so that our sinful body might be done away with,<br/>
that we might no longer be in slavery to sin.<br/>
For a dead person has been absolved from sin.<br/>

was raised, who also is at the right hand of God,<br/>

45,Luke 24: 1-12,"<p>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.” And they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles; but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marvelling at what had happened.</p>",reading,,New Testament

<p>That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognising him. And he said to them, “What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?” And they stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” And he said to them, “What things?” And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>",reading,,New Testament

He acted as if he were going farther, but they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.” So he went in to stay with them. When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened, and they recognised him. And he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, “Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?” And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!” Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p>",reading,,New Testament

For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.” And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marvelling, he said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?” They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate before them.Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed,<br/>
because God tried them<br/>

As gold in the furnace, he proved them,<br/>
and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself.<br/>
Those who trust in him shall understand truth,<br/>

80,The Dash,"<p>I read of a man who stood to speak<br/>
At the funeral of a friendHe referred to the dates on the tombstone<br/>
From the beginning… to the endHe noted that first came the date of birth<br/>
And spoke the following date with tears,<br/>
But he said what mattered most of all<br/>
Was the dash between those yearsFor that dash represents all the time<br/>
That they spent alive on earth.<br/>
And now only those who loved them<br/>
Know what that little line is worthFor it matters not, how much we own,<br/>
The cars… the house… the cash.<br/>
What matters is how we live and love<br/>
And how we spend our dash.So, think about this long and hard.<br/>
Are there things you’d like to change?<br/>
For you never know how much time is left<br/>
That can still be rearranged.If we could just slow down enough<br/>
To consider what’s true and real<br/>
And always try to understand<br/>
The way other people feel.And be less quick to anger<br/>
And show appreciation more<br/>
And love the people in our lives<br/>
Like we’ve never loved before.If we treat each other with respect<br/>
And more often wear a smile,<br/>
Remembering this special dash<br/>
Might only last a little whileSo, when your eulogy is being read<br/>
With your life’s actions to rehash…<br/>
Would you be proud of the things they say<br/>

<p>I won’t be far away, for life goes on.<br/>
So if you need me, call and I will come.<br/>
Though you can’t see or touch me, I’ll be near,<br/>
And if you listen with your heart, you’ll hear.</p>
<p>All of my love around you soft and clear.<br/>
And then, when you must come this way alone,<br/>
I’ll greet you with a smile and “Welcome Home.”</p>",reading,,Poems

89,Watch The Sunset,"<p>I Watch The Sunrise</p>
<p>I watch the sunrise lighting the sky,<br/>
Casting its shadows near.<br/>
And on this morning, bright thought it be,<br/>
I feel those shadows near me.</p>
<p>Refrain:<br/>
But you are always, close to me,<br/>
Following all my ways.<br/>
May I be always close to you,<br/>
Following all your ways, Lord.</p>
<p>I watch the sunlight shine through the clouds,<br/>
Warming the earth below.<br/>
And at the mid-day, life seems to say:<br/>
I feel your brightness near me.</p>
<p>Refrain:<br/>
But you are always, close to me,<br/>
Following all my ways.<br/>
May I be always close to you,<br/>
Following all your ways, Lord.</p>
<p>I watch the sunset fading away,<br/>
Lighting the clouds with sleep.<br/>
And as the evening closes it eyes,<br/>
I feel your presence near me.</p>
<p>Refrain:<br/>
But you are always, close to me,<br/>
Following all my ways.<br/>
May I be always close to you,<br/>
Following all your ways, Lord.</p>
<p>I watch the moonlight guarding the night,<br/>
Waiting till morning comes.<br/>
The air is silent, earth is at rest<br/>
Only your peace is near</p>
<p>Refrain:<br/>
But you are always, close to me,<br/>
Following all my ways.<br/>
May I be always close to you,<br/>
Following all your ways, Lord.<br/>
But you are always, close to me,<br/>
Following all my ways.</p>",reading,,Hymns

92,When I Must Leave You,"<p>for a little while,<br/>
Please do not grieve and shed wild tears<br/>
And hug your sorrow to you through the years,<br/>
But start out bravely with a gallant smile;<br/>
And for my sake and in my name<br/>
Live on and do all things the same,<br/>
Feed not your loneliness on empty days,<br/>
But fill each waking hour in useful ways,<br/>
Reach out your hand in comfort and cheer<br/>
And I in turn will comfort you and hold you near;<br/>
And never, never be afraid to die,<br/>
For I am waiting for you in the sky!<br/>

93,Wind Beneath My Wings,"<p>The</p>
<p>It must have been cold there in my shadow<br/>
To never have sunlight on your face.<br/>
You were content to let me shine, that&#x27;s your way,<br/>
You always walked a step behind.</p>
<p>So I was the one with all the glory<br/>
While you were the one with all the strength<br/>
A beautiful face without a name for so long<br/>
A beautiful smile to hide the pain.</p>
<p>Did you ever know that you&#x27;re my hero?<br/>
And everything I would like to be.<br/>
I can fly higher than an eagle<br/>
For you are the wind beneath my wings.</p>
<p>It might have appeared to go unnoticed<br/>
But I&#x27;ve got it all here in my heart.<br/>
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it.<br/>
I would be nothing without you.</p>
<p>Did you ever know that you&#x27;re my hero?<br/>
And everything I would like to be.<br/>
I can fly higher than an eagle<br/>
For you are the wind beneath my wings.</p>
<p>Did you ever know that you&#x27;re my hero?<br/>
And everything I would like to be.<br/>
I can fly higher than an eagle<br/>
For you are the wind beneath my wings</p>
<p>Fly, fly high against the sky.<br/>
So high, I almost touch the sky.<br/>
Thank you, Thank you,<br/>
Thank god for you,<br/>
Thank God for you the wind beneath my wings.</p>",lyric,,
94,Wisdom 3: 1-9,"<p>Wisdom</p>
<p>3: 1-9</p>
<p>But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God,and no torment will ever touch them.In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died,and their departure was thought to be an affliction,and their going from us to be their destruction;but they are at peace.For though in the sight of men they were punished,their hope is full of immortality.Having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good,because God tested them and found them worthy of himself;like gold in the furnace he tried them,and like a sacrificial burnt offering he accepted them.In the time of their visitation they will shine forth,and will run like sparks through the stubble.They will govern nations and rule over peoples,and the Lord will reign over them for ever.Those who trust in him will understand truth,and the faithful will abide with him in love,because grace and mercy are upon his elect.</p>",reading,,Old Testament

Walk on through the rain<br/>
