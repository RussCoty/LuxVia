1 Corinthians 15:51-5,"Behold! I tell you a mystery.
We shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed,
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.
For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,
and we shall be changed.
For this perishable body must put on the imperishable,
and this mortal body must put on immortality.
When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality,
then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”
“O death, where is your victory?
O death, where is your sting?”
The sting of death is sin,
and the power of sin is the law.
But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.",reading,
1 Thessalonians,"4:13-18



But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.",reading,
1st Letter St. Paul Corinthians 15-20-28,"15: 20-28
Brothers and Sisters:
Christ has been raised from the dead,
the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
For since death came through a human being,
the resurrection of the dead
came also through a human being.
For just as in Adam all die,
so too in Christ shall all be brought to life,
but each one in proper order: Christ the firstfruits;
then, at his coming, those who belong to Christ;
then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom
to his God and Father, when he has destroyed
every sovereignty and every authority and power.
For he must reign until he has put
all his enemies under his feet.
The last enemy to be destroyed is death,
for ""he subjected everything under his feet.""
But when it says that everything has been subjected,
it is clear that it excludes
the one who subjected everything to him.
When everything is subjected to him,
then the Son himself will also be subjected
to the one who subjected everything to him,
so that God may be all in all.

4: 1-2,6-8

I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,
who will judge the living and the dead,
and by his appearing and his kingly power:
proclaim the word; be persistent
whether it is convenient or inconvenient;
convince, reprimand, encourage
through all patience and teaching.
For I am already being poured out like a libation,
and the time of my departure is at hand.
I have competed well;
I have finished the race;
I have kept the faith.
From now on the crown of righteousness awaits me,

will award to me on that day, and not only to me,

Then Peter proceeded to speak and said,
""In truth, I see that God shows no partiality.
Rather, in every nation whoever fears him
and acts uprightly is acceptable to him.
You know the word [that] he sent to the Israelites
as he proclaimed peace through Jesus Christ,
who is Lord of all, what has happened all over Judea,
beginning in Galilee after the baptism
that John preached,
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
with the holy Spirit and power.
He went about doing good and healing all those
oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
We are witnesses of all that he did
both in the country of the Jews and (in) Jerusalem.
They put him to death by hanging him on a tree.
This man God raised (on) the third day
and granted that he be visible,
not to all the people, but to us,
the witnesses chosen by God in advance,
who ate and drank with him
after he rose from the dead.
He commissioned us to preach to the people and testify
that he is the one appointed by God
as judge of the living and the dead.
To him all the prophets bear witness,
that everyone who believes in him will receive
forgiveness of sins through his name.""

Fear (Khalil Gibran),"Fear ( Khalil Gibran)


By Khalil Gibran

It is said that before entering the sea
a river trembles with fear.
She looks back at the path she has traveled,
from the peaks of the mountains,
the long winding road crossing forests and villages.
And in front of her, she sees an ocean so vast,
that to enter there seems nothing more than to disappear forever.
But there is no other way.
The river can not go back.
Nobody can go back.
To go back is impossible in existence.
The river needs to take the risk of entering the ocean
because only then will fear disappear,
because that's where the river will know
it's not about disappearing into the ocean,
but of becoming the ocean.",reading,

24: 13-16,28-35

Now that very day two of them were going to a village
seven miles from Jerusalem called Emmaus,
and they were conversing about all the things
that had occurred.
And it happened that while they were conversing
and debating, Jesus himself drew near
and walked with them, but their eyes
were prevented from recognizing him.
As they approached the village
to which they were going, he gave the impression
that he was going on farther.
But they urged him, “Stay with us,
for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.”
So he went in to stay with them.
And it happened that, while he was with them at table,
he took bread, said the blessing, broke it,
and gave it to them.
With that their eyes were opened and they
recognized him, but he vanished from their sight.
Then they said to each other, “Were not our hearts
burning within us while he spoke to us on the way
and opened the scriptures to us?”
So they set out at once and returned to Jerusalem
where they found gathered together the eleven
and those with them who were saying,
“The Lord has truly been raised
and has appeared to Simon!”
Then the two recounted what had taken place
on the way and how he was made known to them
in the breaking of the bread.

When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him,
she fell at his feet and said to him,
“Lord, if you had been here,
my brother would not have died.”
When Jesus saw her weeping
and the Jews who had come with her weeping,
he became perturbed and deeply troubled,
and said, “Where have you laid him?”
They said to him, “Sir, come and see.”
And Jesus wept.
So the Jews said, “See how he loved him.”
But some of them said, “Could not the one
who opened the eyes of the blind man
have done something so that this man
would not have died?”
So Jesus, perturbed again, came to the tomb.
It was a cave, and a stone lay across it.
Jesus said, “Take away the stone.”
Martha, the dead man’s sister, said to him,
“Lord, by now there will be a stench;
he has been dead for four days.”
Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you
that if you believe you will see the glory of God?”
So they took away the stone.
And Jesus raised his eyes and said,
“Father, I thank you for hearing me. I know
that you always hear me; but because of the crowd
here I have said this, that they may believe
that you sent me.”
And when he had said this, he cried out in a loud voice,
The dead man came out,
tied hand and foot with burial bands,
and his face was wrapped in a cloth.
So Jesus said to them, “Untie him and let him go.”
Now many of the Jews who had come to Mary
and seen what he had done began to believe in him.

Jesus said to the crowds:
“I am the living bread that came down from heaven;
whoever eats this bread will live forever;
and the bread that I will give is my flesh
for the life of the world.”
The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying,
Jesus said to them, “Amen, amen, I say to you,
unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man
and drink his blood, you do not have life within you.
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood
has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day.
For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood
remains in me and I in him.
Just as the living Father sent me
and I have life because of the Father,
so also the one who feeds on me will have life
because of me.
This is the bread that came down from heaven.
Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died,
whoever eats this bread will live forever.”

3:17-26



My soul is bereft of peace;&nbsp;I have forgotten what happiness is;so I say, ""My endurance has perished;&nbsp;so has my hope from the Lord.""



Remember my affliction and my wanderings,&nbsp;the wormwood and the gall!



My soul continually remembers itand is bowed down within me.



But this I call to mind,and therefore I have hope:



The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;&nbsp;his mercies never come to an end;



they are new every morning;great is your faithfulness.""The Lord is my portion,"" says my soul,""therefore I will hope in him.""



The Lord is good to those who wait for him,&nbsp;to the soul who seeks him.



It is good that one should wait quietly&nbsp;for the salvation of the Lord.",reading,

Brothers and Sisters:
None of us lives for oneself, and no one dies for oneself. For if we live, we live for the Lord,
and if we die, we die for the Lord;
so then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.
For this is why Christ died and came to life,
that he might be Lord
of both the dead and the living.
We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God;
for it is written: ""As I live, says the Lord,
every knee shall bend before me,
and every tongue shall give praise to God.""
So then each of us shall give an account of himself
to God.

6: 3-9

Brothers and Sisters:
Are you unaware that we
who were baptized into Christ Jesus
were baptized into his death?
We were indeed buried with him
through baptism into death,
so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead
by the glory of the Father,
we too might live in newness of life.
For if we have grown into union with him
through a death like his,
we shall also be united with him in the resurrection.
We know that our old self was crucified with him,
so that our sinful body might be done away with,
that we might no longer be in slavery to sin.
For a dead person has been absolved from sin.
If, then, we have died with Christ,
we believe that we shall also live with him.
We know that Christ,
raised from the dead, dies no more;
death no longer has power over him.

Brothers and Sisters:
What then shall we say to this?
If God is for us, who can be against us?
He who did not spare his own Son
but handed him over for us all,
how will he not also give us
everything else along with him?
Who will bring a charge against God's chosen ones?
It is God who acquits us. Who will condemn?
It is Christ [Jesus] who died, rather,
was raised, who also is at the right hand of God,
who indeed intercedes for us.
What will separate us from the love of Christ?
Will anguish, or distress, or persecution, or famine,
or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?
No, in all these things we conquer overwhelmingly
through him who loved us.
For I am convinced that neither death, nor life,
nor angels, nor principalities, nor present things,
nor future things, nor powers, nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature
will be able to separate us
from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Luke 24: 1-12,"But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.” And they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles; but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marvelling at what had happened.",reading,
Luke 24: 13-27,"Luke 24:13-27



That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognising him. And he said to them, “What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?” And they stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” And he said to them, “What things?” And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.",reading,
Luke 24: 28-35,"So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, but they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.” So he went in to stay with them. When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened, and they recognised him. And he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, “Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?” And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!” Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.",reading,
Luke 24: 36-48,"As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, “Peace to you!” But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. And he said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.” And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marvelling, he said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?” They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate before them.Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

A highway will be there,

no one unclean may pass over it,
but it will be for his people;

No lion shall be there,

For if to others, indeed, they seem punished,

chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed,
because God tried them
and found them worthy of himself.
As gold in the furnace, he proved them,
and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself.

It is He who protects me from harm
The Lord is the strength of my days;
Before whom should I tremble with fear?

That He grant me my heartfelt desire.

Everyday of my life in His presence

Have mercy on me and give answer.

The Broken Chain,"We little knew the day
God was going to call your name.
In life we loved you dearly.
In death we do the same.
It broke our hearts to lose you
but you didn’t go alone.
For part of us went with you
the day God called you home.
We’re left with beautiful memories.
Your love is still our guide,
And though we cannot see you
You are always at our side.
Our family chain is broken
and nothing seems the same,
but as God calls us one by one
the chain will link again.

The Dash,"I read of a man who stood to speak
At the funeral of a friendHe referred to the dates on the tombstone
From the beginning… to the endHe noted that first came the date of birth
And spoke the following date with tears,
But he said what mattered most of all
Was the dash between those yearsFor that dash represents all the time
That they spent alive on earth.
And now only those who loved them
Know what that little line is worthFor it matters not, how much we own,
The cars… the house… the cash.
What matters is how we live and love
And how we spend our dash.So, think about this long and hard.
Are there things you’d like to change?
For you never know how much time is left
That can still be rearranged.If we could just slow down enough
To consider what’s true and real
And always try to understand
The way other people feel.And be less quick to anger
And show appreciation more
And love the people in our lives
Like we’ve never loved before.If we treat each other with respect
And more often wear a smile,
Remembering this special dash
Might only last a little whileSo, when your eulogy is being read
With your life’s actions to rehash…
Would you be proud of the things they say
About how you spent YOUR dash?",reading,

He makes me down to lie, in pastures green;
He leadeth me the quiet waters by.

My soul He doth restore again,
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
E’en for his own name’s sake.

Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale,
Yet will I fear no ill;
For thou art with me, and thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

My table thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes;
My head thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.

And in God’s house for evermore
My dwelling-place shall be.",lyric,24 The lord's My Shepherd
The Old Rugged Cross,"On a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross,
the emblem of suff ’ring and shame;
and I love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.
Oh, that old rugged cross,
so despised by the world,
has a wondrous attraction for me;
for the dear Lamb of God
left his glory behind
to bear it to dark Calvary.

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.

In the old rugged cross,
stained with blood so divine,
such a wondful beauty I see;
for ‘twas on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died
to pardon and sanctify me.

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross
I will ever be true,
its shame and reproach gladly bear.
Then He’ll call me some day
to my home far away,
where his glory forever I’ll share.

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.",lyric,25 The Old Rugged Cross
The Ship of Life,"Along the shore I spy a ship As she set out to sea;
She spreads her sails and sniffs the breeze
And slips away from me.
I watch her fading image shrink,
As she moves on and on, Until at last she’s but a speck,
Then someone says, “She’s gone.”
Gone where? Gone only form our sight
And from our farewell cries;
That ship will somewhere reappear to other eager eyes.
Beyond the dim horizon’s rim, resound the welcome drums,
And while we’re crying, There she goes!
They’re shouting, Here she comes!
We’re built to cruise for but a while
Upon the trackless sea
Until one day we sail away into infinity.

And when I dream the words are missing
Yes, I know that in a room so full of light
That all the light is missing
But I don't see you with me, with me
Close up the windows, bring the sun to my room
Through the door you've opened
Close inside of me the light you see
That you met in the darkness
Time to say goodbye
Horizons are never far
Would I have to find them alone?
Without true light of my own with you
I will go on ships overseas
That I now know
No, they don't exist anymore
It's time to say goodbye
When you were so far away
I sit alone and dreamt of the horizon
Then I know that you are here with me, with me
Building bridges over land and sea
Shine a blinding light for you and me
To see, for us to be
Time to say goodbye
Horizons are never far
Would I have to find them alone?
Without true light of my own with you

I have so many things to see and do.
You mustn’t tie yourself to me with tears,
Be happy that we had so many years.


I gave you my love, you can only guess
How much you gave to me in happiness.
I thank you for the love you each have shown,
But now it’s time I traveled on alone.


So grieve awhile for me, if grieve you must,
Then let your grief be comforted by trust.
It’s only for a while that we must part,
So bless the memories within your heart.


I won’t be far away, for life goes on.
So if you need me, call and I will come.
Though you can’t see or touch me, I’ll be near,
And if you listen with your heart, you’ll hear.


All of my love around you soft and clear.
And then, when you must come this way alone,
I’ll greet you with a smile and “Welcome Home.”",reading,

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face.
You were content to let me shine, that's your way,
You always walked a step behind.

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain.

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
And everything I would like to be.
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings.

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart.
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it.
I would be nothing without you.
